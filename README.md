# newsletter-api-project
Created a newsletter sign-up web application through the use of the mailchimp API, Javascript, Express, https, npm, Node, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

My server communicates the the Mailchimp API in order to save the emails for a newsletter.

I used Heroku and Git to host this server. You can navigate to this server using this URL:
